### Time Signatures

A time signature

- **groups notes together** within a **bar** (or measure), which are separated by a bar line

It basically organizes the **notes (and rests) in time**. If you need a refresher on notes, visit [Piano Module - Notes](/piano-module-notes/).

Here is an example of a piece of music with a time signature:

![Mountain Rain music line by notesmachine circling the time signature.](https://m-piechatzek.github.io/notesmachinezzzz/assets/03-TIME-SIGNATURES/Mountain_Rain_NotesMachine--time-signature.png)

Time signatures as you can see above, consists of numbers (and sometimes symbols), which tells us which **note** gets a **beat** within a **bar**:

![Treble clef with 2/4 time signature and two quarter notes](https://m-piechatzek.github.io/notesmachinezzzz/assets/03-TIME-SIGNATURES/time-signature--2-4.png "Treble clef 2/4 time")

> "2" beats in each bar
> "4" note type, meaning what note value gets the beat (quarter note in this case)

so **2/4** means each **bar** gets **2 quarter notes** or the **value of 2 quarter notes!**

Here you can see some notes that can be used with 2/4 time signature within each bar:

![Few examples of time signature 2/4 and proper note values for each bar. First bar has two quarter notes, second bar has one half note, third bar has four eight notes.](https://m-piechatzek.github.io/notesmachinezzzz/assets/03-TIME-SIGNATURES/time-signature--2-4-notes.png "2/4 time signature")


So you can see that some notes aren't **quarter notes** but they _add up to_ 2 quarter notes in the bar.

A quick way to remember what note is on the bottom, create a **fraction** => so for 2/4 time signature **replace the top number** with a **1** and look at it as a fraction, 

**1/4 = quarter note**

### Symbols instead of numbers

Sometimes symbols are used instead of numbers, here are a few:

**2/2** also known as **cut time**

![Cut time example with a 'c' and a vertical line through it, is the same as 2/2 time.](https://m-piechatzek.github.io/notesmachinezzzz/assets/03-TIME-SIGNATURES/time-signature--symbols-2-2.png "Cut time")

**4/4** also known as **common time**

![Common time example has a 'c' and is the same as 4/4 time.](https://m-piechatzek.github.io/notesmachinezzzz/assets/03-TIME-SIGNATURES/time-signature--symbols.png "Common time")
