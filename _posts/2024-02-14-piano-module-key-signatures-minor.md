A mini-lesson on how to read piano music minor key signatures. **3 min read (515 words)**

Review major key signatures (link), clefs (link) and sharps and flats (link) before reading this!


Minor key signatures, like major key signatures in a piece of music tell the reader which **piano keys (tones) sound right together**. Minor key signatures are relative to major key signatures, meaning _each minor key_ has the **same key signature** as a _major key_.

You can find out what the key signature is at the beginning of a piece, right beside the clefs and shown with **accidentals** either sharps or flats or none.

As you can see a key signature for a minor key still looks like a major key, since they are related, the differences is how the piece is created.

### Minors related to Majors

From the previous post on majors, you can see there are **15 major keys**, meaning there are **15 minor keys** to know.

![Major Key Signatures]

Let's start with an easy key signature, **C Major**

![C major scale notes]

The **C major** key signature consists of **C, D, E, F, G, A and B** notes and has no sharps or flats, therefore a piece in the **key signature C major** would show **nothing** next to the clef:

![C Major Key Signature in Treble Clef]

It's relative minor will have the same amount of accidentals and the same notes. 

The relative minor of a major can be found by counting down **3 semitones** from the major note, so for C major: **C-> B -> B♭-> A**

**C major's** relative minor is **A**!

![Three semitones down]

A minor key has the same base notes as C major,

![A minor keys]

Now we can see how the circle of fifths fills out with minors,

### Minor key signature scales

Minors have **different versions of scales** _(reminder: scales are notes played in order, ascending and descending, which contain all the notes in it's key, however may be altered),_ the most common are: **natural, harmonic and melodic**.

_(Scales also contain a lot of information and therefore are in another lesson however key signatures are intertwined with scales which help in understanding.)_

- A minor natural: **A - B - C - D - E - F-G - A**
- A minor harmonic: **A - B - C - D - E - F - G# - A**
- A minor melodic: _ascending_ **A - B - C - D - E - F# - G# - A - G ♮- F♮ - E -D - C - B - A** _descending_

Notes are altered depending on the scale, so **harmonic**: 

- the **7th note** is always raised **1 semitone** and 

**melodic,**

- **6th and 7th** are raised **1 semitone** on **ascending** and lowered **1 semitone** on **descending**.
