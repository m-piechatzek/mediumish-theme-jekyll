Minor key signatures, like major key signatures in a piece of music tell the reader which **piano keys (tones) sound right together**. Minor key signatures are relative to major key signatures, meaning _each minor key_ has the **same key signature** as a _major key_.

You can find out what the key signature is at the beginning of a piece, right beside the clefs and shown with **accidentals** either sharps or flats or none.

As you can see a key signature for a minor key still looks like a major key, since they are related, the differences is how the piece is created.

### Minors related to Majors

From the previous post on majors, you can see there are **15 major keys**, meaning there are **15 minor keys** to know.

![The circle shows the relationship between major keys, progressing clockwise by fifths. Each key signature is labeled with the key name and the number of sharps or flats it contains. The key signatures are as follows: C major (0 sharps/flats), G major (1 sharp), D major (2 sharps), A major (3 sharps), E major (4 sharps), B major (5 sharps), F♯ major (6 sharps), C♯ major (7 sharps), F major (1 flat), B♭ major (2 flats), E♭ major (3 flats), A♭ major (4 flats), D♭ major (5 flats), G♭ major (6 flats), C♭ major (7 flats).](https://m-piechatzek.github.io/notesmachinezzzz/assets/06-KEY-SIGNATURE-MAJOR/key-signatures--circle-major.png "Major Key Signatures")

Let's start with an easy key signature, **C Major**

![C major key signature in a treble clef.](https://m-piechatzek.github.io/notesmachinezzzz/assets/06-KEY-SIGNATURE-MAJOR/keyboard-C-Major.png "C major key signature in a treble clef")

The **C major** key signature consists of **C, D, E, F, G, A and B** notes and has no sharps or flats, therefore a piece in the **key signature C major** would show **nothing** next to the clef:

It's relative minor will have the same amount of accidentals and the same notes. 

The relative minor of a major can be found by counting down **3 semitones** from the major note, so for C major: **C-> B -> B♭-> A**

**C major's** relative minor is **A**!

C key and A key are labelled with arrows counting three semitones down starting from C to A showing how to find the minor and numbers under each key starting at 1 on C to 3 on A.](https://m-piechatzek.github.io/notesmachinezzzz/assets/07-KEY-SIGNATURES-MINOR/key-signature-minor-keyboard-semitones.png "Three semitones down")

A minor key has the same base notes as C major,

Now we can see how the circle of fifths fills out with minors,

![The circle shows the relationship between major keys, progressing clockwise by fifths. Each key signature is labeled with the key name and the number of sharps or flats it contains, as well as its relative minor key. The key signatures are as follows: C major (0 sharps/flats) - A minor, G major (1 sharp) - E minor, D major (2 sharps) - B minor, A major (3 sharps) - F♯ minor, E major (4 sharps) - C♯ minor, B major (5 sharps) - G♯ minor, F♯ major (6 sharps) - D♯ minor, C♯ major (7 sharps) - A♯ minor, F major (1 flat) - D minor, B♭ major (2 flats) - G minor, E♭ major (3 flats) - C minor, A♭ major (4 flats) - F minor, D♭ major (5 flats) - B♭ minor, G♭ major (6 flats) - E♭ minor, C♭ major (7 flats) - A♭ minor. ](https://m-piechatzek.github.io/notesmachinezzzz/assets/07-KEY-SIGNATURES-MINOR/key-signatures--circle-major-minor.png "Circle of fifths with minors")

### Minor key signature scales

Minors have **different versions of scales** _(reminder: scales are notes played in order, ascending and descending, which contain all the notes in it's key, however may be altered),_ the most common are: **natural, harmonic and melodic**.

_(Scales also contain a lot of information and therefore are in another lesson however key signatures are intertwined with scales which help in understanding.)_

- A minor natural: **A - B - C - D - E - F-G - A**
- A minor harmonic: **A - B - C - D - E - F - G# - A**
- A minor melodic: _ascending_ **A - B - C - D - E - F# - G# - A - G ♮- F♮ - E -D - C - B - A** _descending_

Notes are altered depending on the scale, so **harmonic**: 

- the **7th note** is always raised **1 semitone** and 

**melodic,**

- **6th and 7th** are raised **1 semitone** on **ascending** and lowered **1 semitone** on **descending**.
