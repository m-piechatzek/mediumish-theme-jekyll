Dynamics are symbols seen in music pieces to indicate volume or intensity.

The symbols for **dynamics** are:

- **_ppp_ - Pianississimo:** play extremely soft
- **_pp_ - Pianissimo:** play very soft
- **_p_ - Piano:** play soft, louder than pianissimo
- **_mp_ - Mezzo piano:** play moderately soft, louder than piano
- **_mf_ - Mezzo forte:** play moderately loud, softer than forte
- **_f_ - Forte:** play loud
- **_ff_ - Fortissimo:** play very loud
- **_fff_ - Fortississimo:** play extremely loud
- **_sfz_ - Sforzando:** play a note with sudden, strong emphasis
- **_fp_ - Fortepiano:** play with a loud attack, then immediately become soft
- **𝆒 - Crescendo:** gets louder in volume
- **𝆓 - Decrescendo:** gets quieter in volume
- **_"n"_** or _"ø"_ or _"○"_ - **Niente:** means literally '**nothing**', may be used at the start of crescendo to "**start from nothing**" or decrescendo to "**fade into nothing**"

Keep in mind that dynamics are _relative_ and that the performer decides on what level of volume and intensity in a specific piece.
