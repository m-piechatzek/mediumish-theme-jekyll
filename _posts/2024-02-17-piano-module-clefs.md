### Clefs

Musical clefs are symbols on top of lines and spaces, which show readers which notes should be played.

Here is an example of the two most common clefs,

On a piano, you generally play with both hands and generally in the middle of the keyboard. 

### Treble Clef

The **right hand** usually plays in the **treble clef** which is this symbol,

It's sometimes referred to as the **G-clef** as it circles the G line. 

The treble clef generally covers from **middle C or C4** (the fourth C key in an 88 keyboard) up to F5 (with some more keys below and above)
