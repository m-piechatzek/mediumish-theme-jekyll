### Notes
A note is a 
- **pitch** and 
- the **length** of time it's pressed on a piano key in your piece.

You push down on a piano key for a long or short period of time, indicating the length, or how many _**"beats"**_ it has.

Above is an example of a piece of music with various notes, a time signature, a key, tempo etc. These notes hold different beats and pitches.

Notes are simple circles and lines that look like:

Name of common notes, symbols, beatsSo when you see a whole note you know it's **pressed down** on the piano key **longer** than a half, quarter etc.

Here is a chart to show the breakdown of some **notes and their length** (beats per note):

Basically, a **whole note** is the main note and the notes below it are smaller in length (which are notes pressed down for less time due to less number of beats).

Here's a bigger chart to reference if needed!

### Good to know
**Beams:** notes can be connected by a bar which makes it easier to read in sheet music:

**Dotted:** notes can hold an extra half of their original beat, meaning they are played for their amount plus half of their amount:

Piano Module - Rests

Rests
A rest is a
break from a note, also known as silence in a moment in your piece

Similar to notes, rests also have a significant duration of time, like beats, in a song.
Here is an example of a piece of music with a rest:
Piece by Notes MachineRests are simple symbols that hold beats, they look like:
Common Rests and names with beatsSo when you see a whole rest (similar to a whole note - link) you know it's a rest or a break on the piano instead of pressing a key.
Here is a chart to show the breakdown of some rests and their length (beats per rest):
Rest chart breakdown with beats breakdownBasically, the rest with 4 beats is exactly as the whole note, which breaks down the same way as shown below: (rests are taken the longest at 4 beats in this chart)

Dotted: rests can hold an extra half of their original beat, meaning they are held for their amount plus half of their amount:
