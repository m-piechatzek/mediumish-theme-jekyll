### Rests

A rest is a

- **break** from a note, also known as silence in a moment in your piece

Similar to notes, rests also have a **significant duration of time**, like beats, in a song.

Rests are simple symbols that hold beats, they look like:


![A visual guide to musical rests and their values. The image shows six types of rests: whole rest (4 beats), half rest (2 beats), quarter rest (1 beat), eighth rest (1/2 beat), sixteenth rest (1/4 beat), and thirty-second rest (1/8 beat). Each rest is depicted with its corresponding symbol and the number of beats it represents in a musical measure. This image provides a comprehensive understanding of how rests are used to indicate silence or a pause in music.](https://m-piechatzek.github.io/notesmachinezzzz/assets/02-RESTS/rests-names-beats.png "Rests Names and Beats")


So when you see a whole rest (similar to a [whole note](https://m-piechatzek.github.io/notesmachinezzzz/piano-module-notes/)) you know it's **a rest or a break** on the piano instead of pressing a key.

Here is a chart to show the breakdown of some **rests and their length** (beats per rest):

The chart includes a whole rest (4 beats), half rest (2 beats), quarter rest (1 beat), eighth rest (1/2 beat), sixteenth rest (1/4 beat), and thirty-second rest (1/8 beat). This visual guide demonstrates how rests are used in music notation to indicate periods of silence or pause, with the rest values broken down for easy comparison.](https://m-piechatzek.github.io/notesmachinezzzz/assets/02-RESTS/rests-chart.png "Rests breakdown chart")


Basically, the rest with 4 beats is exactly as the **whole note**, which breaks down the same way as shown below: (rests are taken the longest at 4 beats in this chart)

### Good to know

**Dotted:** rests can hold an extra half of their original beat, meaning they are held for their amount plus half of their amount:


![The image shows various musical rests with dots next to them, indicating a dotted rest. A dotted rest extends the duration of the rest by half of its original value. For example, a dotted half rest receives 3 beats instead of 2, and a dotted quarter rest receives 1.5 beats instead of 1.](https://m-piechatzek.github.io/notesmachinezzzz/assets/02-RESTS/dotted-rest.png "Dotted Rest")
