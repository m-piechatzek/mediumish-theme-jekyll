### Rests

A rest is a

- **break** from a note, also known as silence in a moment in your piece

Similar to notes, rests also have a **significant duration of time**, like beats, in a song.

Rests are simple symbols that hold beats, they look like:

So when you see a whole rest (similar to a [whole note](https://m-piechatzek.github.io/notesmachinezzzz/piano-module-notes/)) you know it's **a rest or a break** on the piano instead of pressing a key.

Here is a chart to show the breakdown of some **rests and their length** (beats per rest):

Basically, the rest with 4 beats is exactly as the **whole note**, which breaks down the same way as shown below: (rests are taken the longest at 4 beats in this chart)

### Good to know

**Dotted:** rests can hold an extra half of their original beat, meaning they are held for their amount plus half of their amount:
