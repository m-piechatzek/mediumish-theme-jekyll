A mini-lesson on how to read piano music major key signatures. **4 min read (~605 words)**

Review clefs (link) and sharps and flats (link) before reading this!

### Key Signatures

Key signatures in a piece of music tell the reader which piano keys (tones) sound right together. Not all keys sound right when played together, so key signatures help organize which keys sound right, which make up the base keys that create a song.

You can find out what the key signature is at the beginning of a piece, right beside the clefs and shown with accidentals either sharps or flats or none.

The symbols for key signature accidentals are:

- sharp ♯
- flat ♭

### Keys in key signatures

Key signatures can be tricky to understand. They are made up of 7 piano keys and these 7 notes are the base notes used to create a piece. 

Key signatures are easiest explained with scales. Scales are notes played in a row and usually made up of all the notes in a key signature. Scales and key signatures are named after the beginning note in the scale and with the words major or minor (depends on scale note pattern).

Let's start with an easy key signature, C Major

The C major key signature consists of C, D, E, F, G, A and B notes and has no sharps or flats, therefore a piece in the key signature C major would show nothing next to the clef:

We start with C major because it has no sharps or flats in it's key signature. 

The rest of the major scales have either sharps or flats and since each of the 7 white notes (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) can have a sharp or a flat.

Here are all the sharps and flats,

### Circle of Fifths - All major key signatures

A common design to help students remember all the major key signatures are the circle of fifths.

This shows the C major, which has 0 flats or sharps and the 7 major key signatures with sharps and the 7 major key signatures with flats,
