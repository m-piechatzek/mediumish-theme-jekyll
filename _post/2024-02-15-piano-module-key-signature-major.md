### Sharps and Flats

Sharps and flats, which are known as accidentals, are symbols that indicate which key your piece is in, as well as, altering the pitch of the note it is placed next to or near.

Here is an example of sharps indicating key,

![Piece by Notes Machine](https://m-piechatzek.github.io/notesmachinezzzz/assets/05-SHARPS-AND-FLATS/Mountain_Rain_NotesMachine--sharps-flats.png)

The symbols for **accidentals** are:
- double sharps ×
- sharp ♯
- natural ♮
- flat ♭
- double flat ♭♭

and they can look like this in music:

These are organized by **direction** and **semitones** on a keyboard. Sharps go **up** a **semitone** and flats go **down** a **semitone** and naturals bring the note back to its **original pitch**.

### Semitones

It will be easier to understand semitones with a piano:

![Semitone and Whole tone example](https://m-piechatzek.github.io/notesmachinezzzz/assets/05-SHARPS-AND-FLATS/sharps-flats-semitone-wholetone.png)

**Semitone** can be thought of like a **half step** and **whole tone** like a **whole step**, it takes to half steps to make a whole tone. 

> **C -> C# -> D** is a whole tone
> **C -> C#** is a semitone and **C# -> D** is a semitone, equals **C -> C# -> D** a whole tone.

### Sharps

Sharps go up so when you see a sharp next to a note, it is always played **up** one semitone or two if it's a double sharp:

### Flats

Flats go down so when you see a flat next to a note, it is always played **down** one semitone or two if it's a double flat:

### Sharps and Flats in Key signatures

These symbols can also be used to indicate a key a piece is played in. They show up usually next to the clefs. Key signatures can be viewed in another lesson [here]()->needs link.
